# Algorithm Visualization

Algorithm Visualization is a tool to demonstarate the efficiency of different pathfinding algorithms.
The objective is to traverse from the start node to the end node using a pathfinding algorithm. The program can only move horizontally or vertically, with each movement having a cost of one unit/block.
Once the program is complete, the shortest path will be illuminated as a yellow line showing the shortest path between any two nodes.

## Step 1: Choose An Algorithm
Click the 'Algorithms' tab and select one of the algorithms from the dropdown menu.

## Step 2: Draw Walls
Click or hold your mouse down over cells to create walls or you can also click the 'Mazes' tab and select one of the algorithms from the dropdown menu and a randomized maze will be created for you.

## Step 3: Press Start
Press the Start button in the upper right-hand corner to start your pathfinding algorithm!

## Optional: Move Start/End
Hold the mouse down and drag the start/end node to a new location.
